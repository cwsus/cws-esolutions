The CWS eSolutions product is a featured application that provides system/infrastructure management
for all levels.

This is an open-source project, licensed under the Apache Commons 2.0 license and is therefore free
to use, modify or distribute - all I ask is that you let me know before distribution of the product.

If you see something that could be done better, or an error/security issue/etc, please create an issue
for it and I'll fix it.
